Attached, please find the most important geomagnetic measure of magnetosphere in two format (actual values which contains negative integers, and positive Dst which is the shifted version of Dst by +600).

As usual from 1990 to 2011 is for training. This data includes the major storm of January 1995. Test data is from 1975 to 1990. This data includes the famous major storm in March 1989 which caused 9 hours black out in Quebec. Take a look at the following link if you are interested in theses historical occurrence: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_storm

This data is hard to predict, and if we can predict the drop offs which represent the major storms 8 hours a head, our prediction will be in a really good positions compare to the other methods. In fact, it can be used in alarm systems.

We need to use 10 bits no matter if we use the positive Dst or actual Dst. I don't know which of negative representation would be better. We can use twos complement or the regular coding for negative numbers.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any information.

I cannot wait to see the results and analyze the best network to see if it finds a nonlinear relationship between Dst lags.
