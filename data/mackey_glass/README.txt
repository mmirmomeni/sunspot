Attached, please find the MG data reformatted for MN. I considered four decimal points. The maximum is 13284 (1.3284). We have to consider 14 bits for this data set.

This data set is easy to predict. People go to 100 steps ahead sometimes (LE < 0.01). Let's consider 8 as before. To compare with other methods, we can use their prediction horizon later.
